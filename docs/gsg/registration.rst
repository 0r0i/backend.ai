API Registration
================

For managed, best-experience service, you may register to our cloud version of Sorna API service instead of installing it to your own machines.
Simply create an account at `cloud.sorna.io <https://cloud.sorna.io>`_ and generate a new API keypair.
You may also use social accounts such as Twitter, Facebook, and GitHub.

The API keypair is composed of a 20-characters access key (``AKIA...``) and a 40-characters secret key, in a similar form to AWS access keys.

Currently, the service is BETA: it is free of charge but each user is limited to have only one keypair and have up to 5 concurrent kernel sessions for a given keypair.
Keep you eyes on further announcements for upgraded paid plans.
